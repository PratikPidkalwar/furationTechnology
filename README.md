Usage
Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The base URL for the API is http://localhost:3000/api.

Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

GET /api/items - Retrieve all items from the database.
GET /api/items/:id - Retrieve a specific item by its ID.
POST /api/items - Create a new item in the database.

Usage
Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to make HTTP requests to the API endpoints. The base URL for the API is http://localhost:3000/api.

Endpoints
The API provides the following endpoints:

GET /api/items - Retrieve all items from the database.

POST /api/items - Create a new item in the database.
PUT /api/items/:id - Update an existing item by its ID.
DELETE /api/items/:id - Delete an item by its ID.
Please refer to the API documentation or code comments for more details on request payloads and responses.

Error Handling
The API handles errors gracefully and returns meaningful error messages. Common error scenarios, such as invalid requests or missing data, are appropriately handled and responded to with the corresponding HTTP status codes.

Bonus Points
The project includes the following bonus features:

Pagination: The GET /api/items endpoint supports pagination for retrieving items in smaller chunks.
Authentication/Authorization: The API endpoints can be protected with authentication/authorization middleware to restrict access.
